Here i have my notes, errors and thought process it's just the notes i took in order to acomplish this project, what i wanted to do is a script that gives metrics on CPU, disk, memory, processes and also useful info like failed logs and users logged in to see the script itself check [The Github repo](https://github.com/MohamedKamil-hub/Server-Performance-Stats)
