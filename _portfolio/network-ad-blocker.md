A fast, dependency-free, network-wide ad & tracker blocker using only native Linux tools (dnsmasq + bash).

- < 50 KB memory usage
- Blocks 500,000+ domains out of the box
- Can be set up on any Linux device (Raspberry Pi, VPS, router with OpenWrt, etc.)

Perfect drop-in replacement for Pi-hole when you want something lighter and more "Linux-native".
