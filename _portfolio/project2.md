excerpt: >
  Built a customizable Docker image using Alpine Linux that prints a personalized greeting (e.g., "Hello, [Your Name]!") to the console. This project highlights my ability to use Docker ARG and CMD instructions to pass runtime arguments, create flexible containerized applications, and optimize images for simplicity and efficiency.
